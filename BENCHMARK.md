### 4. Production Recommendations

**For Maximum Quality:**
```python
context = Contextuals()
prompt = context.get_context_prompt()  # DEFAULT variant
# Use with gemma3:12b or cogito:8b
```

**For Production Balance:**
```python
context = Contextuals()
prompt = context.get_context_prompt_structured()  # STRUCTURED variant
# Use with cogito:8b or granite3.3:8b
```

**For Speed-Critical Applications:**
```python
context = Contextuals()
prompt = context.get_context_prompt_compact()  # COMPACT variant
# Use with gemma3:1b or granite3.3:2b
```

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited model diversity**: Only 6 models tested
2. **No large language models**: Testing stopped at 12B parameters
3. **Single judge model**: Only Qwen 3 30B used for evaluation
4. **Limited question set**: 11 questions may not cover all use cases

### Future Research Directions
1. **Expand to larger models**: Test 30B+ parameter models
2. **Multi-judge evaluation**: Use multiple judge models for validation
3. **Domain-specific testing**: Evaluate performance on specialized tasks
4. **Real-world application testing**: Measure performance in production environments

## Conclusion

The Contextuals library's prompt variants demonstrate **measurable improvements in contextual awareness** across all tested models. The **DEFAULT prompt variant emerges as the clear winner** for general-purpose applications, while the **STRUCTURED variant offers the best speed-quality trade-off** for production environments.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Use DEFAULT prompt for maximum quality** (6.73/10 average score)
2. **Use STRUCTURED prompt for production balance** (66.33 tok/s, 6.72/10 score)
3. **Choose model size based on speed vs. quality requirements**
4. **MLM models provide significant quality improvements** (+0.7 points) at the cost of speed

The benchmark confirms that **contextual prompts are effective across model sizes**, with the Contextuals library providing a robust foundation for context-aware AI applications.
