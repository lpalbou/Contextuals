2. **Single judge model**: Only Qwen 3 30B used for evaluation
3. **Thinking capabilities**: Only detected in one model
4. **Limited question set**: 11 questions may not cover all use cases

### Future Research Directions
1. **Expand to more large models**: Test additional 30B+ parameter models
2. **Multi-judge evaluation**: Use multiple judge models for validation
3. **Thinking capability analysis**: Investigate impact of reasoning modes
4. **Domain-specific testing**: Evaluate performance on specialized tasks
5. **Real-world application testing**: Measure performance in production environments

## Conclusion

The Contextuals library's prompt variants demonstrate **significant improvements in contextual awareness** across all tested models. The **STRUCTURED prompt variant emerges as the clear winner** for most applications, while the **qwen3:30b-a3b-q4_K_M model with thinking capabilities sets a new performance standard**.

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Use STRUCTURED prompt for maximum quality** (8.21/10 average score)
2. **Choose qwen3:30b-a3b-q4_K_M for premium applications** (thinking capabilities + excellent performance)
3. **Use gemma3:12b for production balance** (good quality, reasonable speed)
4. **Consider model size based on quality requirements** (LLM > MLM > SLM)
5. **Thinking capabilities provide measurable advantages** when available

**Winner: STRUCTURED Prompt + qwen3:30b-a3b-q4_K_M (8.5/10)**

The benchmark confirms that **contextual prompts are highly effective across model sizes**, with the Contextuals library providing a robust foundation for context-aware AI applications. The **STRUCTURED variant's superior performance** makes it the recommended choice for most production use cases.
