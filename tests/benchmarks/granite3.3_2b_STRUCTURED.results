Q5: My computer feels slow. What might be causing this?
Response Time: 1.63s
Answer: Considering the current date (2025) and system version (macOS 15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit), it's likely that memory usage or lack of processing power could potentially be causing your computer to feel slow, especially in a cool climate with clear skies and good air quality (AQI 2). You might want to check the Memory Usage under Activity Monitor or consider if any large applications are consuming excessive resources in the background. If that's not the case, it might be beneficial to ensure your software is updated for optimal performance.

Q6: When would be the best time to schedule a video call with someone in New York?
Response Time: 1.82s
Answer: The current time is 10:29 PM on May 26th, 2025, according to the context data. New York is typically around 7-8 hours behind this timezone.

However, considering the 15 hour difference, that's around 3:29 PM on May 26th local time in New York. Keeping an eye on daylight saving rules if they apply there would be prudent for accuracy.
