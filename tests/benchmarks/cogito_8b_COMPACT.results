Q6: When would be the best time to schedule a video call with someone in New York?
Response Time: 4.33s
Answer: Given it's currently clear and relatively warm (16.73°C), I'd suggest scheduling your video call when daylight is highest - around 2:19 PM (just now) or later, but before New York becomes too busy.

Here's why:
1. At this time (around 20:00 in your current location) it's evening in New York.
2. Daylight is still available, providing good visibility for both participants.
3. Avoid late evenings when many may be wrapping up their day.

If possible, try to schedule around mid-morning until mid-afternoon Eastern Time. This timeframe allows both locations to comfortably interact across the time zone difference.

Q10: When is the golden hour to take photos?
Response Time: 4.64s
Answer: The Golden Hour typically occurs approximately one hour after sunrise and again about one hour before sunset on any given day. 

For your location (temperature 16.73°C, clear skies) today at 20:19:
- Sunset time in your area is around 21:00
- Therefore, the best golden hour photography times would be:
  * 19:59 - 20:30 (before sunset)
  * Tomorrow's Golden Hour would start at approximately 19:59 just before dawn, ending about an hour after sunrise

During these times, natural light is softened and often produces warm, golden tones that are perfect for photography. The long shadows created during this period also add depth to images.

Would you like me to suggest specific compositions or lighting techniques optimized for your current conditions?
